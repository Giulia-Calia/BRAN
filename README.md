# BRAN: a novel tool to explore subclonal genetic variants

BRAN paves the way to the investigation of possible subclonal genetic variants through Illumina whole-genome sequencing data coming from _in vitro_ regenerated plants.
The development of this tool was guided by the previous work by [Fossi _et.al_ (2019)][1]
